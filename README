DASER - Death Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
Game in GLFW and C++11
Takes place in 2D environment, where players shoot lasers at each others.
Lasers reflect and refract to hit even most hidden targets.

The main purpose of this project is to learn OpenGL
...and CMake by the way
...and Git obviously

Most probably, the game will be turn-based like Worms. This is because of Lenz theory of chaos
laws stating even the smallest difference in position at the beginning can mean lot later.
This is important, when lasers tend to reflect several times and hit/miss on other players' computers.
